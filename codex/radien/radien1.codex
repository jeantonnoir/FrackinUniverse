"I met with the lead diplomat of the X'i earlier this week at our briefing regarding the more recent spate of attacks on the outlying colonies. She goes by the name...perhaps title, I am uncertain... of Rupper Gentilly. She's one of the few that can speak enough Common to communicate with us, as well as one of the few that is willing to speak with us at all. No X'i has ever been recorded to be taller than her-- if leaders were chosen by height alone, she'd be a good fit.",
"Standing at 12'7'' or 384cm, she towers over our team of shrimpy humans. It's a little imposing. Ruppur tells tales of how she fought in a war between stars and black holes, and how she helped drive the stars away to save the near-extinct black holes. We aren't quite sure, but we believe the stars may, in fact, be a reference to the Novakid. It wasn't so much what was said, but -how- it was said. If I recall, it was 'The star-children of the First wanted to drive away",
"the anti-children, and so we stepped in'. However, we can find no record of this conflict in any known galactic database. If it happened, it was a long, long time ago."
