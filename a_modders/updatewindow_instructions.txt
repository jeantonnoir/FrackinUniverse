

To give your mod its own update window, simply create a new .txt file, and change the .txt bit into .config (Its name before the dot doesn't matter)
Create a new folder in your mods files named "zb", inside it make another one named "updateInfoWindow"
Inside the "updateInfoWindow" folder, create a new .txt file and write this into it:
[
	[
		{
			"op": "add",
			"path": "/MYMOD",
			"value": {
        		"image" : "PATHTOMYIMAGE",
        		"file" : "PATHTOCONFIG"
        	}
		}
	]
]
Replace "MYMOD" with the name of your mod
Replace "PATHTOMYIMAGE" with the path to the image you'd like to use as the title 
Replace "PATHTOCONFIG" with the path to the first config file you've created
Note that the paths must begin with a /

Example:
[
	[
		{
			"op": "add",
			"path": "/ztarbound",
			"value": {
        		"image" : "/zb/updateInfoWindow/ztarbound.png",
        		"file" : "/_ZBversioning.config"
        	}
		}
	]
]

Optimal title image size is up to 270x24, get bigger than that and it might look weird.

Once you're done with that, save the file, and rename it to "data.config.patch"

Now go back to your first file, and write this in:
{
	"version" : "",
	"changelog" : "",
	"welcome" : "",
	"credits" : "",
	"info" : ""
}
And fill in the information you need.
Note that the window will pop-up on newly created characters, when the mod was first installed, and when "version" field changes.

Example:
{
	"version" : "1.1",
	
	"changelog" : "
-----   1.1   -----
Updated my mod!

----- RELEASE -----
Initial release of my mod!
",

	"welcome" : "
Welcome to my mod!
Hope you enjoy it!
",

	"credits" : "
> Me
> Myself
> My 2nd personality
> My dog
> The man that hides under my bed at night
> Rasputin
",

	"info" : "
Extra info goes here!
"
}

IMPORTANT - Make sure you do not have any spare "s inside the text you want displayed, or the window will break!
