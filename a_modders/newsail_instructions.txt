

		Adding missions to the missions tab:

Because of how SB handles stuff, theres no automatic way to get what missions the player has access to, so it has to be done manually.
They will still appear in the failsafe version.
To add the missions to the tab, you must patch the following line into "\zb\newSail\data.config":
[
	[
		{
			"op": "add",
			"path": "/Data/misc/QUEST TYPE",
			"value": [ "FILE PATH", "REQUIREMENTS" ]
		}
	]
]

Replace "QUEST TYPE" with "main" or "secondary", depending on which tab you'd like the quest to appear.
Replace "FILE PATH" with the the missions file path. Example: "/ai/missionhuman1.aimission"
Replace "REQUIREMENTS" with either a quest ID, or an array of quest IDs. Example: "human_mission1" or ["shoggoth_unlocknew", "shoggoth_wagner"] 

Note that the quest will become available when the player RECEIVES the quest the ID marks (or one of the quests if its an array)
And counts as complete if the player completes a required quest, which will make the mission appear under replays.

Another thing to note is that if your missions icon is outside of "/ai/", it will not be displayed.





		Adding/Removing currencies to/from the currencies tab:
	
By default, all currencies are displayed under the "Unsorted" tab.
If you'd like to hide, or sort your currencies you must do as follows:
Go to your "/currencies.config.patch", and add these values to the currency definitions:

	sail_secret		- Set to 'true' if this currency should be displayed only if the player has the currency (more than 0)
	sail_hidden		- Set to 'true' if this currency should not be displayed in the currency list (overrides 'sail_secret', so no point in defining them both)
	sail_group		- A string for grouping resources together (because 'pairs' is not organized)
						If no group is defined, the resource defaults to 'unsorted'
						Their strings are defined in '\zb\newSail\data.config' inside the 'TextData.currencies' table
	sail_group_order	- Defined only in 'money'(aka pixels), and used to order the groups. Not patching defined groups into this will result in random orders for those groups
						'main' should not be on the list because it is added manually via script, and is always first (I suggest against touching their 'sail_group' value as well)
						'unsorted' should not be on the list because it is added manually via script, and is always last

You can check out the config file in this mod for examples.





		Adding custom functions to the "MISC." tab:

To add functions into the "Misc." tab, you must create a new lua script file, and add your functions there.
Please try making their names unique as to not override any other mods functions, or get your stuff oevrriden by another mod.

Patch the following line into "\zb\newSail\data.config":
[
	[
		{
			"op": "add",
			"path": "/Data/misc/",
			"value": [ "ACTION", "NAME", "IMAGE", "PARAM", "FUNCTION NAME" ]
		}
	]
]

Replace "ACTION" with:
 - "ScriptPane" if you want the option to open a specified pane. (specified within "PARAM")
 - "externalscript" if you want the option to call a function from an external script.

Replace "NAME" with the name you'd like the player to see

Replace "IMAGE" with an icon you'd like displayed on the side. Anything bigger or smaller than 18x18 will look weird.

Replace "PARAM" with: (Follow up to first point)
 - A path to a script panes config if you want it to be opened with the option.
 - A path to the script file containing the function you want called

Replace "FUNCTION NAME" with the name of the function you want called with the "externalscript" option
You can just remove this if you're opening a pane instead.

Note that the functions have full access to the SAIL pane, so you can pretty much modify its behavior and what not through it.
While it may have volatile outcomes, SAIL is fail proofed as much as possible on my end so in case of an error, it will redirect the player to the failsafe AI pane.
But also keep in mind that you may accidentally override any functions therein should you not use proper unique naming for your functions.
