
		Utilizing the quest list system:

- Create a new .config file

- Create a patch for /zb/questList/data.config that has only  this line:
	[{"op" : "add", "path" : "/questlineFiles/", "value" : "MYFILEPATH"}]
	
- Replace MYFILEPATH with the path to your previously created .config file

- Fill out your .config file following the template named "questlist_template.config" provided in the same folder as this document

- After you're done with that, create two folders inside "/zb/questList/" named "banners" and "givers"

- Images for quest lines go into the "banners" folder, and images for sublines go into the "givers" folder

- Quest line images must be have 2 frames in the same image, 164 30 sized, and named "default" and "unavailable".
  Note that some details on the corners of the images are overlapped with a button thats part of the GUI.
  Like so:

{
	"frameGrid" : {
		"size" : [164, 30],
		"dimensions" : [1, 2],
		"names" : [
			[ "default" ],
			[ "unavailable" ]
		]
	}
}

- Subline images don't require a set deminsion, but anything beyond the 164 width won't be visible, and going taller than 16 may overlap quests in lists.
  This image works not only as a visual identifier for players, but also as a separator between lists, so having just a plain line would look nice.
  There is a blank template you can copy and draw over inside "/zb/questList/givers" named "example"

- Quest line and subline image names must be the ID of the quest line/subline they represent.
  Quest line ID is "MyQuestLine", name the image "MyQuestLine"
