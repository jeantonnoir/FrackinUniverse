"All matter in the universe is composed of small packets of energy known as quantas. This energy, which goes into the making up of atoms pulsates or resonates at a particular frequency. Each atom being different therefore, has a slightly different pulsation or frequency.", 
"Thus each material thing being made up of a combination of atoms, called molecules, has its own unique frequency, unlike any other. Now because each individual thing is unique, no potato for instance is exactly like any other potato.",
"There exists an 'empathy' between the whole potato and each of its individual parts. If you slice that potato in half, the frequency of each half is exactly the same. The only example of that frequency anywhere in the universe."
