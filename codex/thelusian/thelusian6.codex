    "While both the X'i and the Thelusian people refuse to divulge the nature of their 'bond' there is no doubting it is there. Thelusians have been seen to viciously defend X'i (even strangers!) without any real explanation as to why. X'ians, when pressed, have implied in their strange language something akin to 'Star Bretheren'. It's rather frustrating, as there is nothing further they care to divulge even when threatened. Personally, I think the reasons are lost to history unless Thelusians have a long-term racial memory they might divulge someday, when trust is earned."
